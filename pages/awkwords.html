            <h1>Awkwords</h1>

            <p class="flavor">Awkwords is a newly founded company whose goal is the help young people 
            struggling with social anxiety to improve their social skills. As they are a new startup, 
            they have no brand presence and need to build their image from the bottom up. I was brought 
            on to provide some guidance and brand guidelines. I'll give you a quick look at my process 
            here!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Before I start anything I create a design brief. These are just a few questions I ask 
            the client to get a better sense of what they are looking for. This helps me as much as 
            it helps them.</p>
